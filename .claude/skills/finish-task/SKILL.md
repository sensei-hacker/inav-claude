# Finish Task Skill

Use this skill when completing a task that involved code modifications.

## Completion Checklist

Complete ALL steps in order:

### 1. Verify All Changes Are Ready

```bash
# Check what's changed
git status
git diff --stat
```

Review that all intended changes are present and no unintended files are modified.

### 2. Run Tests (if applicable)

```bash
# For configurator
cd inav-configurator
npm test

# For firmware - build check
cd inav
make SITL
```

### 3. Stage Changes

Stage files selectively:
```bash
git add <specific-files>
```

Review what's staged:
```bash
git diff --cached --stat
```

### 4. Create Commit Message

Write a clear commit message. **Do NOT mention Claude, AI, or automation.**

**Format:**
```
<short summary - what changed>

<detailed explanation if needed>
- bullet points for multiple changes
- explain the "why" not just the "what"

Fixes #<issue-number>  (if applicable)
```

**Open in gedit for review:**
```bash
# Write message to temp file and open in gedit
cat > /tmp/commit_msg.txt << 'EOF'
<your commit message here>
EOF

gedit /tmp/commit_msg.txt
```

After reviewing/editing in gedit, commit:
```bash
git commit -F /tmp/commit_msg.txt
```

### 5. Push to Remote

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>

# If new branch, set upstream:
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

### 6. Create PR (if appropriate)

**When to create a PR:**
- Task is complete and ready for upstream review
- Branch contains a coherent, reviewable set of changes

**When NOT to create a PR:**
- Work is still in progress
- Changes are local-only or experimental

**Check if PR already exists:**
```bash
gh pr list --head <branch-name>
```

**Create PR using gh CLI:**
```bash
# For configurator
cd inav-configurator
gh pr create --title "<descriptive title>" --body "$(cat << 'EOF'
