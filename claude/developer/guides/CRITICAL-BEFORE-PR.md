# ⚠️ CRITICAL CHECKLIST - Read Before Creating Pull Request

**STOP! Complete this checklist before running `gh pr create` or `/create-pr`:**

## 🚨 TESTING IS MANDATORY

**NEVER create a pull request without testing the code.**

### Required Testing Steps

1. **Code Must Compile**
   ```
   Use inav-builder agent to verify build succeeds
   ```

2. **Code Must Actually Run**
   - Don't just verify it compiles
   - Actually execute and test the functionality
   - Use `test-engineer` agent or SITL for firmware changes

3. **Feature Must Work**
   - Test the specific feature/fix works as expected
   - Verify expected behavior occurs

4. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Try invalid inputs
   - Test with empty data
   - Test boundary conditions

5. **Verify No Regressions**
   - Check that existing functionality still works
   - Run related tests

### If Testing Isn't Possible

If you genuinely cannot test (no hardware, blocked dependencies):
1. **Be explicit in PR description** - state what you couldn't test and why
2. **Request testing** - ask for someone with hardware/setup to test
3. **Never claim "tested" if you didn't actually test**

**Remember:** Untested code can brick expensive flight hardware.

## PR Creation Checklist

### 1. Review Changes
```bash
git status
git diff master...HEAD
git log master..HEAD
```

### 2. Verify All Changes Committed
```bash
git status  # Should show "nothing to commit, working tree clean"
```

### 3. Push to Remote
```bash
git push -u origin branch-name
```

### 4. Create PR
Use `/create-pr` skill or:
```bash
gh pr create --title "Title" --body "Description"
```

### 5. Wait 3 Minutes, Then Check Bots

**After creating PR:**
1. Wait 3 minutes for bots to analyze
2. Use `check-pr-bots` agent or `/check-builds` skill
3. Check for:
   - qodo-code-review suggestions
   - github-actions build status
   - Any failing CI checks

### 6. Address Bot Suggestions

Review bot comments and decide if suggestions are valid:
- Fix legitimate issues
- Respond to questionable suggestions with reasoning
- Don't ignore bot feedback

## PR Description Requirements

**Include:**
- Summary of changes
- Testing performed (be specific)
- Related issue number (if applicable)

**Do NOT mention:**
- Claude or AI assistance
- "Generated by" statements

---

**All items checked? Proceed with PR creation.**
