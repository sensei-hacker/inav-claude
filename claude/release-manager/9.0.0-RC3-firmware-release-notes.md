## Overview
This release candidate introduces new features and improvements for testing before the official INAV 9.0.0 release. Users are advised to remove props and verify motor/servo outputs before first battery power-up, as flexible motor and servo allocation may alter default output configurations.

## Key Highlights

### Minimum Ground Speed Flexibility
The Programming Framework now enables dynamic adjustment of minimum ground speed based on wind conditions, allowing aircraft to maintain headway in challenging flight environments.

### OSD Throttle Gauge
A new vertical digital throttle gauge display option provides pilots with real-time throttle visualization on-screen.

### Fixed Wing Altitude Control
Two selectable altitude control methods accommodate different airframe types and climb rate requirements:
- Altitude Velocity controller (default)
- Altitude Position controller (alternative)

### Position Estimator Improvements
Enhanced Z velocity accuracy through algorithm refinements and new default weighting parameters for barometric and GPS measurements.

### Sensor Additions
New QMC5883P magnetometer driver support expands hardware compatibility.

## Other Notable Changes

- Barometer altitude integrated into CRSF telemetry
- Improved fixed-wing flight detection for auto-disarm functionality
- Temperature compensation for accelerometers and barometers
- Flight counter addition to statistics tracking
- Enhanced VTOL tilt-rotor support with servo speed filtering
- Improved magless multicopter yaw estimation
- Extended MSP override capability to 32-bit channels

## CLI Updates

**New Settings** include blackbox arm control extension, temperature correction factors, ADSB warning styles, and VTOL transition PID multipliers.

**New Flight Controller Targets**: 32 additional targets now supported, including variants from Blueberry, DakeFPV, TBS, and others.

## OSD/CMS Changes

New elements: `OSD_VERTICAL_SPEED_INDICATOR`, `OSD_ADSB_WARNING`, `OSD_ADSB_INFO`, `OSD_THROTTLE_GAUGE`, and `OSD_NAV_MIN_GROUND_SPEED`.

## Upgrade Instructions

From INAV 8.0, users must perform full chip erase during flashing and reload configuration via CLI diff commands. Phased loading of multi-profile settings is recommended for safety.
