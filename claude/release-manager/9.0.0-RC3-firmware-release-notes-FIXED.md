## Known Issues in 9.0

* Please read INAV Github [issue](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/issues) reports for outstanding problems that were not resolved in time for the release.

# Upgrading from a previous release

## Upgrading from INAV 8.0 

1. Backup configuration with CLI `diff all` command or use the _Diff All_ and _Save to file_ buttons.
2. Download and install the new [INAV Configurator 9.0](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/releases)
3. Flash INAV 9.0 **WITH** _Full Chip Erase_ option enabled 
4. Load your 8.0 `Diff` settings in to the CLI. Then take a note or write down the incompatible settings changes marked in RED. 
5. Then copy your 8.0 `Diff` file and rename it 9.0. And edit the old incompatible settings.
6. Now go to the Status Tab and press the _Reset Setting_ button.
7. Select _Keep current settings_ from the defaults pop-up.
8. Go to CLI and load your edited INAV 9.0 `Diff`
9. Done

>[!Tip]
> **Concerning step 8**.   
> It can be a safer option to load your `Diff All` settings in two parts if you are using multiple Profiles. e.g. _Control, Mixer or Battery_.   
>This can be done by copying and loading the `Diff All` text setting from the top, down to the bottom of the `# master` settings category. Then load that into the CLI and press enter. Once it has written, press the _Save Settings_ button.   
>Wait until it reboots and go back to the CLI tab again, then copy and load the rest of the `Diff All` text file. Starting from the `# Control_profile 1` settings category, down to the bottom. Press enter. Once written, it will save by itself.


## Upgrading from older versions

Please follow the instructions on [this](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Upgrading-from-an-older-version-of-INAV-to-the-current-version) page.

# Highlights

## Minimum ground speed flexibility
Via the [Programming Framework](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/blob/master/docs/Programming%20Framework.md). It allows the user to have more flexibility when flying in higher wind conditions. To ensure the airplane makes headway.   
In addition, you can program it to dynamically adjust the minimum ground speed according to the Wind direction and Wind speed.     
More information can be found in this [link](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/pull/10720). 


## OSD throttle gauge 
Allows the pilot to see the throttle as a vertical digital gauge.  
Functional information can be found here in the [PR link](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/pull/10725)

## Fixed wing altitude controller
Changes have been made to improve its operation on a broader range of airframes. One of two methods can be selected to better suited different climb rate conditions.    
* Altitude Velocity controller `nav_fw_alt_use_position = OFF` (default)    
* Altitude Position controller `nav_fw_alt_use_position = ON`
  
See [here](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/Navigation-PID-tuning-(FW)#altitude-control-methods) for more information. And the _required_ PID tune settings for either control method.

## Position estimator improvements
Changes to the position estimator are mainly intended to improve issues with Z velocity accuracy but also includes code clean-ups and fixes.   
There has also been setting changes added with the code alterations. Depending on the sensor data quality. It may be beneficial in some cases to revert your settings back to the old ones, or somewhere in between the two.
