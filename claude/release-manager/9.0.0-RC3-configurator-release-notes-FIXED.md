# Important changes

## Esri World Imagery
* Bing Maps is out of service. _INAV Mission Control_ now uses Esri World Imagery. With the benefit of not requiring an API key.

## OSD changes
* Rename Vario to Vertical Speed Indicator in the OSD tab.
* ADSB improved aircraft warning.
* Extra flexibility surrounding fixedwing minimum ground speed. Wind speed and Direction flight parameters have also been added to the programming Framework. [#2382](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/pull/2382)
* A vertical throttle indicator can now be selected on the OSD for faster reference than the numerical percentage indicator  [#2354](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/pull/2354)

## SmartPort telemetry options
This allows pilots to quickly set the telemetry sensors used by both the OpenTX telemetry widget and ETHOS telemetry dashboard. [#2416](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/pull/2416)


## Language support
The INAV Configurator now supports Ukrainian.

## Programming Framework with Javascript syntax
Use Javascript to program custom actions on your craft

## Programming Framework (IPF)
The `Active` column in the programming framework as been moved in front of the operand conditions. This order is easier to follow, thinking of the `Active` in terms of an IF statement. It might not matter to non-programmers. But is more intuitive for programmers.

## Various bug fixes
* Mission control WP land fix. [#2371](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/pull/2371)
* Servo mixer speed value overflow. [#2326](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/pull/2326)
* Fixedwing Level pitch trim accuracy fix. [#2421](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/pull/2421)
* Various configurator ESM updates and fixes.

## Important notes
* Always read [README.md](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/blob/master/README.md)
* Always read the full [firmware release notes](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/wiki/8.0.0-Release-Notes)
