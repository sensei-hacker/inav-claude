# INAV 9.0.0 Incompatible Settings Changes

**Date Generated:** 2025-12-07
**Compared:** 8.0.1 → 9.0.0-RC3 (edf50292)

This document lists CLI settings that have been **renamed** or **removed** between INAV 8.0.1 and 9.0.0. These changes will cause errors (marked in RED) when loading an 8.0.x `diff all` into INAV 9.0.

## Critical Renaming: PID Profile → Control Profile

The term "PID Profile" has been renamed to "Control Profile" throughout INAV 9.0 to better reflect that these profiles control more than just PID settings.

### Renamed Settings

| Old Name (8.0.x) | New Name (9.0.0) | Notes |
|------------------|------------------|-------|
| `controlrate_profile` | `use_control_profile` | Selects which control profile to use |
| `mixer_pid_profile_linking` | `mixer_control_profile_linking` | Links mixer profile to control profile |
| `osd_pan_servo_pwm2centideg` | `osd_pan_servo_range_decadegrees` | Pan servo range renamed for clarity |

### Removed Settings

| Setting Name | Reason | Replacement |
|--------------|--------|-------------|
| `reboot_character` | Legacy MSP reboot method removed | Use standard MSP reboot command |
| `PG_CONTROL_RATE_PROFILES` | Internal parameter group renamed | Now `PG_CONTROL_PROFILES` |
| `PG_SERIAL_CONFIG` | Internal refactoring | Not user-facing |

## Migration Instructions

When upgrading from INAV 8.0.x to 9.0.0:

1. **Backup** your configuration with `diff all` in INAV 8.0.x Configurator
2. **Flash** INAV 9.0.0 with **Full Chip Erase** enabled
3. **Load** your 8.0.x diff in CLI - incompatible settings will be marked in **RED**
4. **Manually update** the renamed settings:
   ```
   # Example: If your 8.0.x diff contains:
   set controlrate_profile = 2

   # Change it to:
   set use_control_profile = 2
   ```
5. **Remove** settings that no longer exist (like `reboot_character`)
6. **Save** your updated diff and reload it

## How to Find Incompatibilities

When you paste your 8.0.x `diff all` into the INAV 9.0.0 CLI:
- **RED text** = Incompatible setting (removed or renamed)
- **WHITE text** = Compatible setting (will be applied)

## Additional Notes

- All documentation has been updated to use "Control Profile" terminology
- The functionality remains the same - only the names changed
- Profile switching and linking works identically to 8.0.x

## For Release Managers

This document was generated by comparing `settings.yaml` between releases:

```bash
cd inav
git diff 8.0.1..9.0.0-RC3 -- src/main/fc/settings.yaml | grep -E "^[\+\-].*name:"
```

For future releases, check both:
- `src/main/fc/settings.yaml` - Main settings definitions
- `src/main/cli/cli.c` - CLI command changes
