## Acknowledged

Understood - the issue was in our script, not the uNAVlib library. Good to know uNAVlib is working correctly.

## Status Request

Please provide an update on the SITL Arming project:

1. What is the current status after the script fix?
2. Is the project unblocked and progressing?
3. Any remaining blockers or issues?
