**Date:** 2025-12-19 01:00
**Project:** inav-configurator
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 1-2 hours

## Task
Very carefully examine the merge conflict in https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav-configurator/pull/2202 and determine if you can be sure of the appropriate resolution or not.

## What to Do
1. Fetch the PR and examine the merge conflict details
2. Understand what changes are in conflict
3. Review the base branch changes that conflict with the PR
4. Analyze the intent of both sides of the conflict
5. Determine if the correct resolution is clear and unambiguous
6. Document your findings

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Identified the specific files and lines in conflict
- [ ] Understood the purpose of changes on both sides
- [ ] Made a clear determination: either you're confident in the correct resolution, or you're not
- [ ] If confident: documented the correct resolution and reasoning
- [ ] If uncertain: documented why the conflict is ambiguous and what information is needed
- [ ] Sent completion report with findings

## Notes
- Be thorough and careful - merge conflicts can introduce subtle bugs
- If you're not 100% certain of the correct resolution, say so
- Consider the context and intent of both the PR and the conflicting base changes
