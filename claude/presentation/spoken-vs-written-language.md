# Spoken vs. Written Language: How to Sound Like You're Talking, Not Reading

This guide explains the key differences between written and spoken language, and how to make your presentation sound conversational rather than like reading a script.

---

## 1. Sentence Length and Complexity

### Written/Reading Sound
Long sentences with multiple clauses, subordinate phrases, and complex structures.

**Example:**
"The implementation, which was completed after extensive testing, demonstrated significant improvements in performance across all metrics."

### Spoken/Natural Sound
Shorter, choppier sentences. Break complex ideas into digestible chunks.

**Example:**
"We finished the implementation. Did a lot of testing. And it performed way better across the board."

**Why it matters:** When you read a long sentence aloud, you sound like you're reading. Natural speech uses pauses and breaks.

---

## 2. Formal vs. Conversational Vocabulary

### Written Language
- utilize → use
- facilitate → help
- implement → do/build
- demonstrate → show
- subsequently → then
- terminate → end/stop
- commence → start
- endeavor → try
- ascertain → find out
- expedite → speed up

### Spoken Language
Pick the simpler, everyday word almost always.

**Written:** "This enables more efficient resource allocation"
**Spoken:** "This lets you use resources better"

**Written:** "We endeavored to ascertain the root cause"
**Spoken:** "We tried to figure out what caused it"

---

## 3. Contractions

### Written Language
Formal writing avoids contractions:
- do not, cannot, it is, we will, should not, would not

### Spoken Language
Natural speech uses contractions constantly:
- don't, can't, it's, we'll, shouldn't, wouldn't

**Impact:** Nothing makes you sound more like you're reading than saying "do not" and "cannot" instead of "don't" and "can't."

---

## 4. Starting Sentences

### Written Language
Traditional writing rules say don't start sentences with:
- However, Furthermore, Moreover, Nevertheless
- In addition, Consequently, Therefore
- And, But, So (considered grammatically incorrect)

### Spoken Language
Natural speech starts sentences with simple connectors:
- But, And, So, Plus, Also, Or

**Written:** "However, the system encountered difficulties. Nevertheless, we persevered."
**Spoken:** "But the system had problems. So we kept going."

---

## 5. Passive vs. Active Voice

### Passive Voice (Written)
"It was determined that the system could be optimized"
"The solution was implemented by the development team"
"Improvements were observed in the metrics"

### Active Voice (Spoken)
"We figured out we could optimize the system"
"The dev team implemented the solution"
"We saw the metrics improve"

**Why it matters:** Passive voice removes the human actor, making it sound formal and distant. Active voice sounds like a person talking.

---

## 6. Nominalizations (Turning Verbs into Nouns)

Nominalizations make speech sound stiff and bureaucratic.

### Nominalized (Written)
- implementation of the solution → implementing the solution / we implemented it
- improvement of performance → performance improved / it got faster
- optimization of the process → we optimized the process
- utilization of resources → using resources
- examination of the data → we examined the data

**Written:** "The implementation of the solution resulted in improvement of performance"
**Spoken:** "When we implemented the solution, performance improved"

---

## 7. Hedging and Qualifiers

### Written Language
Precise, definitive statements:
- "The system reduces errors by 47%"
- "Performance improved significantly"
- "The implementation was successful"

### Spoken Language
Natural uncertainty and hedging:
- "The system cuts errors - I think it's around 47% or so"
- "Performance got a lot better"
- "The implementation worked out pretty well"

**Natural qualifiers:** kind of, sort of, basically, pretty much, around, about, roughly, like

---

## 8. Repetition

### Written Language
Avoids repetition by using synonyms and varied sentence structures:

"The developer implemented the feature. The programmer then tested the functionality. The engineer documented the solution."

### Spoken Language
Comfortable with repetition:

"The developer implemented the feature. The developer then tested it. The developer documented it."

**Why it matters:** In speech, we naturally repeat words. Hunting for synonyms makes you sound like you're reading a thesaurus.

---

## 9. Filler Words and Natural Disfluencies

### Written/Reading Sound
Every word is perfectly placed. No hesitations, no corrections, no natural pauses.

"We implemented the system and optimized the performance parameters."

### Spoken Natural Sound
Includes natural speech patterns:

"So, uh, we implemented the system and basically just, you know, optimized how it performs."

**Common fillers:** um, uh, like, you know, I mean, basically, actually, so, well

**Note:** You don't need to script these in, but if you're naturally using them while speaking, don't fight it. They make you sound human.

---

## 10. Question Tags and Rhetorical Questions

### Written Language
Tends to avoid informal questions:

"This approach provides significant benefits. The system becomes more reliable."

### Spoken Language
Uses questions to engage:

"This approach is way better, right? The system becomes more reliable. You know what I mean?"

**Question tags:** right?, you know?, make sense?, see what I mean?

**Rhetorical questions:** "So what happened?", "Why does this matter?", "What's the solution?"

---

## 11. Parentheticals and Asides

### Written Language
Uses actual parentheses, em dashes, or separates into new sentences:

"We built this system (which took considerable time) and deployed it successfully."

### Spoken Language
Natural breaks and tangents:

"We built this system - and by the way, it took forever - but it works now."

"We built this system. Took forever, actually. But it works now."

---

## 12. Abstract vs. Concrete Language

### Abstract (Written)
- utilization of resources
- implementation phase
- operational parameters
- architectural decisions
- methodological approach
- strategic initiative

### Concrete (Spoken)
- using the stuff we have
- when we built it
- how it runs
- choices about structure
- how we did it
- what we're trying to do

**Why it matters:** Abstract language creates distance. Concrete language makes things real and relatable.

---

## 13. Personal vs. Impersonal

### Impersonal (Written)
"It is recommended that..."
"One should consider..."
"The data indicates..."
"Observations were made..."

### Personal (Spoken)
"I recommend..."
"You should think about..."
"The data shows..." / "We found..."
"We noticed..." / "I saw..."

**Use:** I, we, you - not "one" or "it is"

---

## 14. Emphasis Techniques

### Written Language
- ALL CAPS
- **Bold text**
- *Italics*
- Exclamation marks!!!

### Spoken Language
- Changes in pitch, volume, and pace
- Pauses before important words
- Repetition for emphasis
- Natural stress patterns

**Problem:** When you read written emphasis markers (like ALL CAPS), you often over-emphasize unnaturally.

---

## Example Comparisons

### Formal/Written Style:

"The implementation of context engineering principles facilitated significant improvements in system reliability. Subsequently, the adoption of role-based architectures enabled more efficient resource utilization across all operational parameters. This methodology demonstrates considerable promise for similar applications."

### Conversational/Spoken Style:

"So we used context engineering, and it made the system way more reliable. Then we added role-based stuff, and that helped us use resources better across everything. This approach works really well - you could probably use it for similar projects."

---

### Another Example:

**Written:**
"However, the system encountered significant challenges during implementation. Nevertheless, through careful optimization and iterative refinement, performance improvements were achieved."

**Spoken:**
"But we hit some problems when we built it. So we optimized things and kept tweaking it. And eventually, we got it to perform better."

## Practical Tips for Speakers

### 1. **Write how you talk, not how you write**
When preparing notes, say them out loud as you write. If it sounds weird when you say it, rewrite it.

### 2. **Use contractions liberally**
Replace every "do not" with "don't", every "cannot" with "can't".

### 3. **Break long sentences**
If a sentence has more than 15-20 words, consider breaking it into two sentences.

### 4. **Start sentences with "But," "And," "So"**
This is how people actually talk. Ignore the grammar rules you learned in school.

### 5. **Choose simple words**
If there's a simpler word that means the same thing, use it.

### 6. **Be okay with repetition**
Don't hunt for synonyms. Just use the word again.

### 7. **Add "right?" and "you know?"**
These natural speech patterns help you connect with your audience.

### 8. **Use "we" and "I" and "you"**
Make it personal. You're talking to people, not writing a journal article.

### 9. **Practice reading your notes aloud**
If you stumble over a phrase, it's too complex or unnatural.

### 10. **Don't fight natural speech patterns**
If "um" and "uh" come naturally, that's fine. They make you sound human.

## Red Flags You're Reading, Not Talking

If you hear yourself saying these, you're in "reading mode":

- ❌ "However," "Nevertheless," "Furthermore"
- ❌ "One should consider..."
- ❌ "It is recommended that..."
- ❌ "The utilization of..."
- ❌ "Implementation of..."
- ❌ "Cannot," "do not," "will not" (without contractions)
- ❌ Sentences longer than 20 words
- ❌ Zero filler words or pauses
- ❌ Perfect synonym variation (never repeating words)
- ❌ No questions, no "right?", no "you know?"

---

## Green Flags You Sound Natural

- ✓ Starting sentences with "But", "And", "So"
- ✓ Using contractions naturally
- ✓ Short, punchy sentences
- ✓ Simple, everyday vocabulary
- ✓ Comfortable repeating the same words
- ✓ Using "I," "we," "you"
- ✓ Natural pauses and "um"s
- ✓ Question tags: "right?", "you know?"
- ✓ Concrete examples over abstract concepts
- ✓ Active voice ("we did X") not passive ("X was done")

## Application to the INAV Presentation

Here are specific fixes we made to make the presentation more conversational:

### 1. Title Slide
**Before:** "Making Claude Code work better through context management"
**After:** "How I got Claude to stop forgetting things"

*Why:* Second version sounds like something you'd actually say to a friend.

### 2. Emphasis
**Before:** "Each role sees ONLY what it needs!"
**After:** "Each role sees just what it needs"

*Why:* ALL CAPS and exclamation marks are written emphasis. Natural speech would just stress "just."

### 3. Formal Language
**Before:** "dramatically more effective"
**After:** "way more reliable"

*Why:* "Dramatically" is formal writing. "Way" is how people actually talk.

### 4. Corporate Speak
**Before:** "professional software development process"
**After:** "real development workflow"

*Why:* First phrase sounds like HR or marketing. Second sounds conversational.

### 5. Jargon
**Before:** "context pollution"
**After:** "extra noise"

*Why:* More concrete, less technical-sounding.

### 6. Abstract to Concrete
**Before:** "The structure is reusable."
**After:** "You can reuse the structure."

*Why:* Active voice with "you" is more personal and direct.

### 7. Intensity Markers
**Before:** "Process Consistency: VERY HIGH"
**After:** "Process Consistency: Really high"

*Why:* "Really high" is how you'd say it. ALL CAPS looks like reading a report.

## Summary

**The core principle:** If it sounds weird when you say it out loud, it's probably too formal or written.

The best presentation notes sound slightly "wrong" when you read them silently because they're written for speaking, not reading.

**Test everything by saying it out loud before you present it.**
