# YouTube Video Strategy: Context Engineering Presentation

## Recommended Title

**"I Fixed Claude's Memory Problem: From 110k Lines to 2,500"**

**Subtitle in description:** "Context engineering techniques that made Claude Code 10x more reliable on a 150,000-line codebase"

### Why This Works
- "I Fixed" → personal credibility, implies you solved it
- "Memory Problem" → relatable, non-technical term for the issue
- Numbers → concrete, impressive reduction
- Short enough to be fully visible on mobile (54 characters)

---

## Alternative Title Options

### 1. Problem → Solution Format
**"I Fixed Claude's Biggest Problem: It Kept Forgetting My Instructions"**
- Immediately relatable pain point
- 69 characters (good length)
- "I" makes it personal/credible

### 2. Results-Focused (with numbers)
**"How I Reduced Claude's Context from 110,000 Lines to 2,500"**
- Specific, dramatic improvement
- Numbers grab attention
- Implies a method you can learn

### 3. Curiosity Gap (most "YouTube-y")
**"Why Claude Code Keeps Messing Up (And the 4 Fixes That Actually Work)"**
- Promises specific actionable solutions
- "Actually Work" implies others have failed
- Number creates expectation

### 4. Before/After Format
**"Claude Code: Before and After Context Engineering"**
- Clear transformation story
- Shorter, cleaner
- Less clickbaity, more professional

### 5. Direct Value Proposition
**"How to Make Claude Code Work on Large Codebases (150k+ Lines)"**
- Speaks to specific audience (people with big projects)
- Clear promise of solution
- Professional tone

## Effective Title Principles

**DO:**
- Start with the payoff/benefit (not the method)
- Use specific numbers when you have them
- Address a pain point the viewer recognizes
- Front-load the hook (first 40 chars matter most)
- Use simple language (not "context engineering")

**DON'T:**
- Use jargon in the title (save it for the video)
- Make promises you don't deliver
- Use ALL CAPS or excessive punctuation
- Hide the value proposition

## Thumbnail Strategy

### Recommended: Split Screen Before/After

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  LEFT SIDE (RED)     │  RIGHT SIDE (GREEN)│
│  ❌ Claude's Context │  ✅ Focused Context │
│  [Saturated/         │  [Clean box with   │
│   overflowing text]  │   "2,500 lines"]   │
│                      │                    │
│  "110K LINES"    →   │   "2.5K LINES"     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Alternative 1: Problem Focus
```
TOP: Large text "Claude Keeps Forgetting?"
MIDDLE: Frustrated emoji or screenshot of repeated errors
BOTTOM: "Here's Why →"
Background: Your face (if comfortable) looking concerned/thoughtful
```

### Alternative 2: Solution Focus
```
TOP: "4 Fixes That Work"
MIDDLE: Four numbered boxes/icons representing:
  1. ROLES
  2. JIT DOCS
  3. AGENTS
  4. HOOKS
BOTTOM: Screenshot of successful result
```

### Thumbnail Design Rules
- **Font size:** Readable at 320px wide (mobile size)
- **Colors:** High contrast (avoid pastels)
- **Text:** 3-7 words maximum
- **Faces:** If you include yourself, use an expressive face (concerned → satisfied)
- **Clarity:** Should be understandable in 1 second
- **Dimensions:** 1280x720 pixels (16:9 ratio)
- **File format:** JPG or PNG under 2MB

## Opening Hook (First 10 Seconds)

The first 10 seconds determine if people keep watching.

**Script:**

"I was working on a 150,000-line codebase with Claude Code, and it kept making the same mistakes over and over. I'd tell it 'check the lock file before starting,' and the next session? It would forget. I'd say 'use the build agent,' and it would run make directly again. So I fixed it."

**Then:** Show the before/after diagram immediately (around 15-second mark).

## Target Audience Signals

Include these in description/tags to reach the right people:

**Tags:**
- Claude Code
- Large codebase
- AI coding assistant
- Context window management
- Prompt engineering
- Software development workflow
- Developer productivity
- AI tools
- Anthropic Claude
- Code automation

**Description Format:**
```
Working with Claude Code on large codebases? Getting frustrated with it forgetting your instructions?

I reduced Claude's context from 110,000 lines to 2,500 using four techniques:
• Role separation
• Just-in-time documentation
• Specialized agents
• Enforcement hooks

This video walks through the exact system I built for a 150k-line drone firmware project.

Timestamps:
0:00 - The Problem
2:15 - Role Separation
5:30 - Just-in-Time Docs
8:45 - Specialized Agents
12:00 - Enforcement Hooks
15:30 - Real Example
18:00 - Results & Takeaways

## Content Strategy Notes

**Thumbnail-Title Synergy:**
The thumbnail visually shows "110K → 2.5K" while the title explains what that means ("Fixed Claude's Memory Problem"). They reinforce each other.

**Delivery Style:**
Based on the conversational speaker notes in your presentation, maintain that same approachable, honest tone in the video. Don't oversell - the results speak for themselves.

**Call to Action:**
End with: "If you want to try this on your own codebase, check the GitHub link in the description. I've open-sourced the whole structure."

## Analytics to Track

After posting, monitor:
- **Click-through rate (CTR):** Should be 4-8% for tech content
- **Average view duration:** Aim for 50%+ (people watching to midpoint)
- **Traffic sources:** YouTube search vs. suggested videos
- **Audience retention graph:** Where people drop off

If CTR is low (<3%), consider testing a different thumbnail or title. If retention drops early, strengthen the opening hook.
