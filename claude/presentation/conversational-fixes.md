# Suggested Conversational Fixes

## High Priority - Sales Pitch Language

### 1. Title Slide Tagline (Line 76)
**Current:** "*Making Claude Code work better through context management*"
**Sounds like:** Product marketing tagline
**Suggested:** "*How I got Claude to stop forgetting things*"
**Or:** "*Fixing Claude's context overload problem*"

---

### 2. Slide 5 - Role Benefits (Line 263)
**Current:** "### Each role sees ONLY what it needs!"
**Issue:** ALL CAPS + exclamation mark = very sales-pitch-y
**Suggested:** "### Each role sees just what it needs"

---

### 3. Slide 7 - Communication System (Line 328)
**Current:** "**No searching through project docs - no context pollution**"
**Issue:** "context pollution" is jargon
**Suggested:** "**No searching through project docs - no extra noise**"

---

### 4. Slide 8 - Multiple Places
**Current (line 418 speaker notes):** "Clean, focused context."
**Current (line 304 speaker notes):** "Clean information flow that's part of the twelve-step process."
**Issue:** Sounds like corporate speak
**Suggested:** Just remove "Clean," - say "focused context" or "The twelve-step process keeps information flowing to the right place."

---

### 5. Slide 10 - Agent Summary (Line 467)
**Current:** "Main session never loads this - agents handle it!"
**Issue:** Exclamation mark feels promotional
**Suggested:** "Main session never loads this - agents handle it."

---

### 6. Slide 12 - Hooks Title (Line 600)
**Current:** "### Hooks enforce best practices automatically!"
**Issue:** Exclamation mark + "best practices" sounds corporate
**Suggested:** "### Hooks enforce the rules automatically"

---

### 7. Slide 13 - Real Example (Lines 629, 654)
**Current:** "**Focused workflow wins**"
**Issue:** Sounds like an advertising slogan
**Suggested:** "**The focused approach works**"
**Or:** "**That's the difference**"

---

### 8. Slide 13 Speaker Notes (Line 673)
**Current:** "Claude follows a professional software development process, not just ad-hoc code generation."
**Issue:** "professional software development process" is very corporate
**Suggested:** "Claude follows a real development workflow, not just ad-hoc code generation."

---

### 9. Slide 14 - Results (Line 685)
**Current:** "**Process Consistency:** <span class="stats">VERY HIGH</span>"
**Issue:** ALL CAPS sounds like a business report
**Suggested:** "**Process Consistency:** <span class="stats">Really high</span>"
**Or just:** "**Consistent process**" (remove the rating entirely)

---

### 10. Slide 14 - Results (Line 710)
**Current:** "• Professional dev process"
**Issue:** Corporate abbreviation
**Suggested:** "• Follows a real workflow"

---

### 11. Slide 15 - Principles (Line 760)
**Current:** "**These patterns work for ANY large codebase**"
**Issue:** ALL CAPS "ANY" is very sales-pitch-y
**Suggested:** "**These patterns work for any large codebase**"

---

### 12. Slide 16 Speaker Notes (Lines 769, 777)
**Current:**
- "The system literally improved its own working environment."
- "The system documents itself as it learns."
**Issue:** Formal, sounds like product documentation
**Suggested:**
- "The system actually improved itself."
- "It documents what it learns along the way."

---

### 13. Slide 16 - Slide Text (Lines 799, 821)
**Current:**
- "**Our project improves its own environment**"
- "**System documents itself as it learns**"
**Issue:** Bold declarations feel promotional
**Suggested:**
- "**The project improved itself**"
- "**It documents what it learns**"

---

### 14. Slide 17 Speaker Notes (Lines 733-738, 847-849)
**Current:**
- "The structure is reusable."
- "The beauty is you don't need to build everything at once."
- "The patterns are proven."
- "Adapt them to your codebase and get the same benefits we've seen."
**Issue:** Mix of formal declarations and marketing language
**Suggested:**
- "You can reuse the structure."
- "You don't need to build everything at once."
- "These patterns have worked well."
- "You can adapt them to your codebase."

---

### 15. Slide 17 - Bottom CTA (Line 896)
**Current:** "### Clone `.claude/` and `claude/` → Customize → Benefit!"
**Issue:** Arrow format + "Benefit!" = classic marketing CTA
**Suggested:** "### Clone `.claude/` and `claude/`, then customize for your project"

---

### 16. Closing Slide Tagline (Lines 943-944)
**Current:** "*Context engineering turns Claude from a smart assistant into a reliable, professional development team member*"
**Issue:** This is pure marketing copy with "professional"
**Suggested:** "*Context engineering makes Claude way more reliable*"
**Or:** "*This is how you make Claude actually follow your process*"

---

## Medium Priority - Stiff Formal Language

### 17. Slide 3 Speaker Notes (Line 122)
**Current:** "That's what context engineering fixes."
**Issue:** Sounds like a closing pitch line
**Suggested:** "Context engineering solves this."
**Or just:** "That's the problem context engineering solves."

---

### 18. Slide 3 Speaker Notes (Line 107)
**Current:** "Today I'm going to show you five principles that solved these problems and made Claude dramatically more effective."
**Issue:** "dramatically more effective" sounds like a claim
**Suggested:** "Today I'm going to show you five principles that solved these problems and made Claude way more reliable."

---

### 19. Slide 11 Speaker Notes (Line 494)
**Current:** "Together they create a system where Claude consistently follows best practices without needing constant reminders."
**Issue:** Long formal sentence with "best practices"
**Suggested:** "Together they make Claude follow the right process without constant reminders."

---

### 20. Slide 12 Speaker Notes (Line 554)
**Current:** "Hooks are like guardrails that keep Claude on the right path automatically."
**Issue:** "on the right path" sounds a bit formal/corporate
**Suggested:** "Hooks are like guardrails that keep Claude from making the same mistakes."

---

## Summary of Patterns to Fix

**Avoid:**
- Exclamation marks (except emojis)
- ALL CAPS for emphasis
- "Professional" / "best practices" corporate speak
- Bold declarations that sound like feature highlights
- "The beauty is" / "The power of" marketing phrases
- Arrow-based call-to-action formats
- Taglines and slogans

**Prefer:**
- Simple, direct statements
- "way more" instead of "dramatically more"
- "really" instead of "VERY"
- "actually" instead of "literally"
- Remove unnecessary emphasis
- Natural speech patterns
